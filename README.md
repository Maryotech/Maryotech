Threat Intelligence Project
Here's my most recent Project on Threat Intelligence Project

Author-Mary Obadoni

This project explores threat actor research and TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mapping using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The goal was to investigate a real-world threat group, analyze their techniques, and deliver actionable intelligence for defence strategy.
The research focused on identifying, profiling, and mapping the behavior of a high-profile threat actor. Using open-source intelligence platforms such as AlienVault OTX, MITRE ATT&CK, and threat feed aggregators, I created a structured threat profile aligned with the 14 MITRE ATT&CK Tactics.
